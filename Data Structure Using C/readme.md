About This Project

This project implements an advanced stack data structure in C, far beyond the traditional static-array stack.
It includes dynamic memory allocation, linked list structure, undo/redo operations, and file persistence,
making it much more powerful and practical.

🔥 Features

1.Unlimited-size stack using Linked List
2.Undo/Redo functionality using auxiliary stacks
3.Save stack to file
4.Load stack from file
5.Modular, clean, scalable code
6.Beginner-friendly menu system

Usage : 

On running, the program presents a menu:
1.Push: Add an element to the stack
2.Pop: Remove the top element
3.Undo: Reverse the last pop operation
4.Redo: Reapply the last undone operation
5.Display: Show all stack elements
6.Save: Persist the stack to a file
7.Load: Load stack from a file
8.Exit: Quit the program

🧠 Why this is an upgrade?

The original stack implementation used a fixed array and only supported push/pop/display operations.
This version evolves that into a professional-grade, extensible, real-world stack system with dynamic behavior, persistence, and advanced operations.
